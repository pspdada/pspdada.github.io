## Pre-commit

This project uses [pre-commit](https://pre-commit.com/) to run checks before committing code. To set it up, run:

```bash
# 1. Install pre-commit
pip install pre-commit
pre-commit --version

# 2. Add a pre-commit configuration
# create a file named .pre-commit-config.yaml
pre-commit sample-config

# 3. Install the git hook scripts
pre-commit install

# 4. Run against all the files
pre-commit run --all-files
```

## Prettier

This project uses [Prettier](https://prettier.io/) for code formatting. To set it up, run:

```bash
# 1. Install Prettier
npm install --save-dev --save-exact prettier

# 2. Create a configuration file
node --eval "fs.writeFileSync('.prettierrc','{}\n')"
node --eval "fs.writeFileSync('.prettierignore','# Ignore artifacts:\nbuild\ncoverage\n')"

# 3. Add a format script
echo '{
  "scripts": {
    "format": "prettier --write ."
  }
}' > package.json

# 4. Run Prettier
npx prettier . --write
```

### ðŸš€ Project Structure

Inside of your Astro + Starlight project, you'll see the following folders and files:

```
.
â”œâ”€â”€ public/
â”œâ”€â”€ src/
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ assets/
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ content/
â”‚   â”‚   â””â”€â”€ docs/
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ content.config.ts
â”œâ”€â”€ astro.config.mjs
â”œâ”€â”€ package.json
â””â”€â”€ tsconfig.json
```

Starlight looks for `.md` or `.mdx` files in the `src/content/docs/` directory. Each file is exposed as a route based on its file name.

Images can be added to `src/assets/` and embedded in Markdown with a relative link.

Static assets, like favicons, can be placed in the `public/` directory.
